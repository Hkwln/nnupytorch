<h1> Getting to know pytorch</h1>

Here I do simple excercises to get into pytorch

How do you orientate here:
The exciting folders are 
- single layer neural network: here i experiment with only single layer neural network and discuss the usecase of such
- sentiment_analysis:
     here i coded a rnn which can give you the mood of a message: positive,negative,neutral
            imports.py just imports all packages
            interactiv_predictions.py here you can run the programm
            experimental_model.py testing network
            stable_model.py stable network
            main.py here is where the action is, the dataloading, the network and the training
            
- Binary_classification:
    Here is a model which creates 2 different classes of points and classifies them
        dataset.py creates the dataset
        data_visualization.py plots the batches
        Multiclass_classificatioin.py Here you run the program and is the dataloading, the network and the training
- Convolution neural network:
    Here is a cnn which which is still in progress, it should recognize simple math symbols like circle, kite,parallelogram, rectangle, rhombos, square, trapezoid, triangle.
- Tests:
    Here is a cudacheck test to see if cuda works on your system and a model, which is a model blueprint that helped me
