Here is my plan to improver the sentiment_analysis software I have done:

-save the preprocessed embeddings 
ideas: in a .pt or .pkl document to load them 
aim: decrease the Runtime
 I did implement a saving the preprocessed data, but don't seemed to help on decreasing the runtime, maybe saving the weights and biases would help


-optimize/experimenting then model architecture
ideas: for example try GRU or LSTM instead of vanilla run_name
aim: increase the performance

- Maybe move the process to the GPU
